How would you describe the command line in plain English in a couple of sentences? Can you think of an analogy for it?

It's like having a conversation with a robot, in its own language where you can ask it to do anything you want, but it's ultra specific and picky. 



Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

Yes!


Name five commands you used and what they do.

ls - lists out all files under the current directory 
open . - opens the current directory from terminal.
Command k - clears terminal window. 
Ls - git checkout -b  - Locally creates a new branch and switches to it. 
Git push - pushing commit to GitHub repository. 



Did you learn anything unexpected?

Committing and Pushing can all be done from terminal and it's super intuitive.
